## Mandata EVA
# Your personal local database, Basiclly made for anything you like. API, Remoteable, Host any type of data even txt files, Easy to deploy, Cost Free.

Free localhost database, Hostable for linux, mac, windows, All without nerdy coding.

NOTE: This runs 24/7 no stop that means if you perhaps left python running in the backround which can overload your RAM and CPU and mostly Storage. Also this can be used for training an AI Model which is trained on APIs and IPs and Tokens


Deploy:
- Install python 3.10 or newer
- Install the Python Ping3 package, This is used for Lilyhosting API Ping.
- Git this repo
- Cd to the repo ```cd mandata-v2-eva-python```
- Run ```python mandata.py```, The Data in the code root will be moved to a folder named "database-local"
- Now the last step, Make "database-local" be a shareable folder in your network. this will make the folder remoteable from anywhere you are


Not needed but you can do after the deployment
- Get a duckdns subdomain for the shareable folder, so you can use it anywhere [Used if your IP is nonpublic and is localhost only]


Something mostly asked here: What does EVA Mean
- Means this app needs an license, Cuz it was first made in katcode which req a license to use, and we made the app in python for you free ballers to use this. but has half the things No KVMKC Database Host cuz KVMKC was made in katcode, No API use which means you cant host it with api key bypass for that is a domain. but still has the remoteable and api and host anydata type but is MORE easyer to deploy


LOWEST hardware to run
- 1GB Storage or more
- 64MB RAM or more
- 800Mhz 1 core CPU or more
