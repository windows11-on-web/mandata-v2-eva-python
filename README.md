# Your personal local database, Basiclly made for anything you like. API, Remoteable, Host any type of data even txt files, Easy to deploy, Cost Free.

Free localhost database, Hostable for linux, mac, windows, All without nerdy coding.

NOTE: This runs 24/7 no stop that means if you perhaps left python running in the backround which can overload your RAM and CPU and mostly Storage. Also this can be used for training an AI Model which is trained on APIs and IPs and Tokens

Deploy:
- Install python 3.10 or newer
- Install the Python Ping3 package, This is used for Lilyhosting API Ping.
- Git this repo
- Cd to the repo ```cd mandata-v2-eva-python```
- Run ```python main.py```, The Data in the code root will be moved to a folder named "database-local"
- Now the last step, Make "database-local" be a shareable folder in your network. this will make the folder remoteable from anywhere you are

Not needed but you can do after the deployment
- Get a duckdns subdomain for the shareable folder, so you can use it anywhere [Used if your IP is nonpublic and is localhost only]
